# Trend-Detection

In this project, we focus on detecting the trends in event-based communities, such as the Meetup social network. 
We extracted a dataset from the Meetup api, which included events of various categories and the members who attended them.
We examined several methods time applicable to the field of trend detection on the basis of time series.
Specifically, we studied the performance of the following methods: Simple Moving Average, Linear Regression and Non Linear Regression. 
Also, we implemented a more efficient approach on data manipulation using a MapReduce method instead of the more common single core approach.
